Weâ€™re excited to announce that LogicStar will soon be an official affiliate of the ETH Zurich AI Center! This partnership is a significant milestone for us, especially since many of our team members have deep roots in AI research at ETH.

At LogicStar harness AI along classical computer science to empower engineering teams and AI agents to autonomously maintain commercial applications, enabling faster cycles and improved application quality.

As AI is central to our mission, we strive to stay at the forefront of AI research and innovation. Being affiliated with the ETH Zurich AI Center allows us to do just that. We're excited to collaborate as we advance the field of agentic AI for application maintenance together!
