We're a passionate team of researchers and entrepreneurs, driven by a love of innovation and a frustration with old-school network monitoring tools. 
With our strong background in computer networking and AI from years of research at ETH Zurich, we are ready to push the limits and shape the future of network monitoring!

        Our mission is to revolutionize network monitoring:<br>
        <strong>From Chaos to Clarity</strong>
   </h2>
   In today's world, computer networks are the backbone of our daily lives, businesses, and economies. 
   So when network outages or performance hiccups occur, they can be devastating. 
   Yet, most current monitoring solutions are stuck in the pastâ€”relying on outdated data sources, overwhelming users with alerts, and reacting only after problems arise. 
   This leaves network operators scrambling to piece together information manually and leads to costly downtimes for businesses worldwide.<br><br>
   At NetFabric, we're flipping the script on network observability. Our innovative approach fuses the precision of research-driven mathematical models with the flexibility of advanced machine learning to create a monitoring solution that truly gets modern networks.<br><br>
   Our dual strategy - leveraging mathematical models and AI - offers a connected, comprehensive view across diverse data sources. 
   We add meaningful context to alerts, guide operators to key issues seamlessly, and even forecast potential scenarios. 
   This empowers operators to focus on critical tasks, optimizing both debugging and planning efforts. 
   Welcome to the future of network observability! <br>
